<b>Analyse sex and age around cosplay market in Thailand</b>  

This R program will plot a data into picture for you!  

I always wonder why are there many young female more than young male in copslay event. So I just collect some sample data in local cosplay trading group in Thailand, the country I live.  

Please remind that this is only SAMPLE collected in the cosplay market. It does not represent to ALL cosplayer in Thailand.  
Some are not in this kind of group or any trading market.
